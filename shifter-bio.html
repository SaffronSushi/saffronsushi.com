        <h1>SHIFTER</h1>
        <p>
            Initially written in Python, this is a remake of one of the first games I ever made.  
            It was created when I wanted to see what would happen if different color values of the 
            game's elements were effected by the player's position, using different axis.

        <h2>How "shifting" is done</h2>
        <p>
            Each object in the game has its own color property in the form of a string, in this case "rgba()".
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Shifter()</strong> object is responsible for dividing this string into useable values to be manipulated, 
            bringing those values back together into a string format (as used by Canvas API), and (most importantly) changing 
            given color values based on the position (within a specified axis) of a given object.  It is modular enough to 
            be used on any object with position and color values, for example: the player object can be used to manipulate 
            itself as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Parsing levels</h2>
        <p>
            All levels are parsed from JSON files, using an XMLHttpRequest().  
            These files include the basic settings for each game object, including layout as well as how the their color 
            properties will be handled.
        </p>
        <p>
            The layout of these objects are specified using separate arrays, where different characters represent their 
            x and y coordinates.
        </p>
        <img src='' alt='Screenshot of array showing the player&apos;s position.'>
        <p>
            The walls in particular have wide range of possible symbols.  For walls that don't change color, these are 
            used to specify the brightness of a given hue (red, green, blue, and alpha values each have their own arrays).  
            For walls that change color, these specify which axis to base their changes on, and which direction the 
            player moves to increase brightness.
        </p>

            <img src='' alt='Screenshot of array showing wall layout.'>
            <figcaption>
                Numbers, and letters from "a" to "f" represent walls.  
                <br>"x", "y", and "z" represent walls that change color in-game 
                (capitalization is also relevant).

        <h2>Player movement and collision</h2>
        <p>
            Player movement relies on movement flags based on key inputs.  Event listeners are used to change these flags.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Player "update()" function, negative movement (like moving left) is subtracted from positive movement, 
            and multiplied by a "speed" property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the "update()" function, all walls are cycled through and are checked for collision.  If a collision 
            occurs, the player will be sent back to the wall's border.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Move assist:</strong>
            <br>If the player pushes against a wall <i>and</i> 
            is positioned over a corner, the player will be moved away from the wall to position it so it is free to 
            move past the wall.
        </p>
