                        I'm 22 years old, I'm mostly self-taught, and I program because it's what I like to do.  I'm more than willing to learn new software, and I'm no stranger to learning new solutions on the fly (mostly while in the shower).
                    </p>

                        My main skillset involves a core understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.  I also have a baic understanding of version control through Git.  I intend to deepen my understanding of these languages and their frameworks as I work, and am willing to get into backend development as well   (it might just take a few extra showers to click).
