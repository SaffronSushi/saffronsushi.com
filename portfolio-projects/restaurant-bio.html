            I wanted to make a simple website to demonstrate CSS, media queries, and embedding.  
            I decided to go with a mockup for a restaurant site (I was also craving Italian).
        </p>
        <p>
            The site was designed for use one both desktop and on mobile devices, with media queries 
            used to detect screensize.  An iframe from Google maps is used to show the restaurant location 
            (not a real one, of course).
        </p>
